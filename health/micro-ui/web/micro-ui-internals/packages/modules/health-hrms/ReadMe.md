## Initialization module
1. Fetches Logged-in Staff Details:
   It retrieves the logged-in userâ€™s staff information to personalize the data fetch for the user.

2. Fetches Associated Project Data:
   Based on the staff record, it fetches the linked projects to which the user is assigned.

3. Fetches National Level Project Data:
   If the project has a hierarchy (like sub-projects), it fetches the national or parent project to get the boundary details.

4. Fetches and Processes Boundary Data:
   It retrieves the administrative boundaries linked to the project and arranges them in a hierarchical order using getBoundaryTypeOrder, ensuring boundaries are handled consistently across the module.

5. Stores Data in Session Storage:
   Fetched staff projects and boundary hierarchy are stored in session storage to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls during the session.
